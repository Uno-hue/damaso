        <h3>My Father (Robert Damaso) </h3>
        <p>My father is a responsible and hardworking man, and a lot of what he does for our family goes unnoticed because he never makes a big deal out of it. He just quietly takes on every responsibility, even when he’s tired, and he still finds a way to guide us and make sure we’re okay.</p>

        <p>My mother is the person who holds our family together with her love and patience. She’s the one who makes our home feel warm, safe, and alive. No matter how tired she is, she always finds a way to care for us, to listen, and to make sure we never feel alone.</p>
